# Glossary

**AXI** (Advanced eXtensible Interface) : parallel high-performance communication interface mainly designed for on chip communication (i.e. between ARM processor and FPGA on Zynq).

**CPU** (Central Processing Unit) : can be simply called processor, it is a chip that performs tasks through a list of instructions usually to control other components.

**DSP** (Digital Signal Processor) : processor specialised in numeric data computing, it is optimised for pipelined or parallel calculations of large data set (multiplications, divisions, ...).  

**FPGA** (Field Programmable Gate Array) : reprogrammable integrated circuit.

**PL** (Programmable Logic) : programmable logic of a Zynq relates to the FPGA

**PS** (Processing System) : processing system of a Zynq relates to the ARM processor

**RTL** (Register Transfer Level) : digital portions of a design (synchronous logic, combinatory logic, registers, ...), RTL is usually generated by VHDL/Verilog.

**SoC** (System on Chip) : integrated circuit that implements electronic system (almost always includes processor).

**VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) : description language used to generate hardware design.

**Zynq** : Xilinx SoC that integrates ARM-based processor with FPGA and hardware acceleration (CPU, DSP, ...)
