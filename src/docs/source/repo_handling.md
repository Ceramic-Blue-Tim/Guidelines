# Repository handling

## Introduction to Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle projects sources with speed and efficiency. The first step is to get through the basic theory of git. While a good mastery of git requires several hours of study and practices, basic use of the elementary notions **commit**, **push**, **pull** and **branches** can be mastered in a reasonable amount of time. Plenty of tutorials are availables on that matter.

## Repository hosting

As for the tutorials, numerous hosting platforms for git repository are availables GitLab, BitBucket or GitHub. The latter being the one currently used for many reasons amongs the convenient organization features.

I advise you to get a clear Name/Username for your GitHub profile to make it simple for organization management.

```Bash
If your Bruce Wayne a good setting would be
Name : Bruce Wayne
Username : bwayne
Bio : Intern at Gotham University
```

## Environment

Depending on your skills and experience you could use a full command approach with bash or rely on a graphic interface such as GitHub Desktop or Sourcetree. Sourcetree being the one currently used for its user-friendly approach and its incorporated bash.

## Organise folder
```Bash
Repository
├───c
├───data
├───doc
